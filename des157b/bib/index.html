                            This article goes through the relationship between low income and mental issue. Based on the data from CDC, the article emphasized that people who has low income would be easier to have mental issues. Through reading this article, I would gain the information of poverty and mental problems. It provides me the circumstances of low income people when they are facing mental issues and addressed several reasons that might cause their mental sickness. Therefore, this article could contribute to my work by listing out the main connections between poverty and mental issue, laying the foundation for my topic.

                            This journal is mainly focused on children from low income families. It pointed out that living circumstances during children's childhood could affect their mental health. To explain what caused this issue, researchers analyzed the relationships between the children and their families. By reading this article, I would have a basic conception of how to improve children’s mental health if they are living in low income families. It inspired me the contents I could included on my personal project—aiming on providing elements that can lower the stressing levels of viewers. At the same time, the research data in this journal could encouraged me go deeper into the field of mental issues, leading me to create a prototype that could utilize the data from this research. As a result, the details of this journal are meaningful for my future researches.

                            This is a short article which addresses the connection between social issues, poverty and mental health. This article is not only focused on mental health issues, but also reflect how the social roles of people could generate the stress. Also, the questions are displayed to audiences through the analysis on economy. Even though a lot of specific terminologies related with economy are used in this article, it provides a wider view for me. After reading this article, I would reconsider how the structure of the society generates poverty and what my project could do to eliminate the social gap. It might be hard to relate my project with social gap but I would like to go deep in this area. In the future research, this might also create new ideas for my website.
