                            Project Summary 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In this project, I am aiming on designing a desktop version website that could help people from low income families to relieve their mental stresses through the displaying of graphic designs. 
                      
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Project Goals
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For this project, my goal is that people could find a place online to relax when they are stressing. I hope that I could create an immersing experience for users by utilizing psychological resources. At the same time, in this project, I hope that I could use color to affect people 's emotions. For this part, I have to do more mental health related researches. Other than this, I wish users don't have to worry about privacy problems and won't be stressed if they don't know enough information about mental health issues.

                            Design Strategies 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In this website, it would include several scenes that designed by me with the help of different APIs and libraries. There would be a main page that users could access and then they could enter the scenes that help them to relieve their stresses based on the information they provided to the website. All the scenes could be considered as a trip that could lead users to take a short break from their stressful moments.                         </p>

                            Interaction Strategies
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the design strategies part, I mentioned that users could access on the main page and provide their personal information. In order to make sure that the scenes could be chosen based on psychological knowledge. I decided to create a checklist for the users to input their information. Therefore, the range of the input can be determined and it can be easier to explained by psychological knowledges. Since this website could include a lot of mental health knowledge, I would schedule an interview with my friend who is major in psychology to get some advice.

                            Experience Goals
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            First, I am aiming on creating free mental relief experience that every users could have without considering about their own budgets. Second, I hope that this experience could actually help with their situations. The experiences I created are focusing on the process of storytelling.
