                            1.Users could input their choices in the checklist.
                            2.Users could control the graphics' movement
                            3.Users could send feedbacks after the interactions.
                            4.Users could check how many people used this webpage.

                            Three.js: I am planning to use this to show the interactions between viewers and graphics. Viewers could control the graphics' movement with their mouses.
                            Back4App: I would use this to store users' input data.
                            UI Api: This would be used to record visiting numbers.

                            I previously worked with Three.js before and I wanted to admit that this is a powerful tools to create interactions with graphics.
                            I would be more confident with this library once I finish some personal researches.
                            For Back4App, I learned about how to store the dada through class assignments. Therefore, I could use this in the final project without worrying about
                            the learning process.
                            I still have to learn how to use UI Api and I hope I can finish the learning process before this Friday.
