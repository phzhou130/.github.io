                            Project:
                            I decided to improve my Game on project in order to let 
                            players have more interactions with it in an attractive way.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Comparison 1(images are on the bottom of this page):
                            I hope I can add more interesting interaction effects on my game. Therefore, I was doing research on games that needed constant interactions with users. I found the game Drop The Number. This game can only be played on mobile apps but I enjoy the concept. In my final project, I hope I could lead my players constantly press on the stuff that dropped from the top of the screen and use this as a way to earn points. This could encourage gamers to keep their attention on my game and earn a continuous game effects from the game. I noticed that this type of game might need a lot of coding work so I still have to do some research on JavaScript.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Comparison 2:
                            Also, I got some inspiration from a game that I always played as a kid. This game is called Fruit Ninja, created in 2010. When I was a kid, I enjoyed playing this game because every time there were different fruits appearing on my iPad. When I was looking at this game, I noticed that there are two points I could learn from it—simpleness and interaction. The whole interface of this game is very simple, containing only the fruits as the main graphics. However, the dropping of fruits brings up players’ curiosities, encouraging players to press on the fruit and see the scores they could gain. Therefore, I hope I could integrate these two points into my final project. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Project Goals:
                            My project will also display the dropping of stuff on the screen. Players have to gain points based on how many stuff they caught. However, my game would have a storyline. Players are helping the cat and the dog to catch their treats. The more bones are caught, the dog will have more scores. In contrast, the more fishes are caught, the cat would have more scores. 
                            There are two similarities between my game and these two games. First, all of them need constant feedback from users to enter the next steps. Second, they all calculate the points from users based on probability.

                        <p>
                            Design Strategies:
                            Since the main characters in my game are cat and dog, I would like to create a color palette that bring up the warmness in players’ deep thoughts. At the same time, the illustration of this game is supposed to be simple and clear. I won’t make it too complex because I hope users won’t need a long time to figure out the actions they needed to take. Also, the main page of this game would have a hierarchy, leading players to pay attention to the central points. 
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Interaction Strategies:
                            The time based animations are the dropping of fishes and bones from the top of the page. Whenever players press on the fishes and the bones, they would faded into the background. Since users are gaining points based on pressing the bones and fishes, mouse movement is also a main interaction between users and the game. Visually, the mouse would be designed as a shape that could fit the topic, such as a net that could catch fishes. Other than these interactions, I might add something else during the coding process.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Experience Goal:
                            I hope I could provide a time period for users to relax and enjoy the game. Therefor, I chose pets as the main characters of this game. When players are helping the pets to catch their treats by pressing on the treats (bones and fishes), they might think about the pets they have. Even though the players don't have a pet, they could still enjoy this game as it provided a lot of interactions. I am planning to achieve this by keep tracking with the graphics I created. I hope the graphics on this game could help players relaxing. Therefore, if any graphics are not matching with the theme, I will try to reiterate it. At the same time, I will test the model of this game with my friends to improve the user interface.
