                            User test1:
                            <br>
                            Vivian Tai
                            <br>
                            While Vivian was testing my game, she was spending a long time to read the rubric. During the gaming process, I observed that she was struggling on how to control the bowl’s movement at first. However, once she got used to it, she fluently played this game. After testing this game, Vivian pointed out that the layout of this game affected her to read through the rubric at first. Therefore, I decided to integrate her points by adding an overlay to introduce the game. Then, users would enter the playing session of this game.

                                <img src="./usertest1.jpg" alt=test >
                                <figcaption>Vivian</figcaption>    
                            </figure>
                      
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            User test2:
                            <br>
                            Erika
                            <br>
                            While Erika was playing the game, she showed similar actions as Vivian. She was also spending a long time in reading the rubric. Other than this, when she tried to replay this game, the keyboard doesn't work. This might caused by a bug in the original code. I decided to take Erika’s feedback about improving the background of this game. She pointed out that the interaction of this game is perfect but it could be visually better if I add more graphics on the background. I decided to follow this advice by creating more elements that related with pets on the background images. Also, I was spending time to debug the keyboard problem—it won't work if users reload the website.

                            User test3:
                            <br>
                            Krithika:
                            <br>
                            While Krithika was playing the game, she finished reading the rubric in a short time. However, she seems confused when she noticed that there wasn't a boundary to control the bowls’ movement. In the feedback session, Krithika mentioned that it would be better if each players move their bowls in the same range. In my original design, it supposed to work the same as what Krithika mentioned. However, there are some errors in the Javascript, causing the two players’ movement in different range. I would like to fix this after the user test. Other than this, Krithika said that she enjoyed playing this game.

                            </figure>
                            <br>

                            In general, I want to say thank you to all the testers!
