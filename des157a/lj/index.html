                            I took my image when I was in the summer
                            of my freshman year. I was talking my high school
                            roommate next to the seaside in Shenzhen, China.
                            We were sharing our new experiences in college. 
                            The view was very pretty in that evening, leading me to take the picture.
                            I chose this image because I had a memory when 
                            I was taking the picture. Also, I love the balance of the layout.
                            I randomly took it but it turns out to have a good layout,
                            displaying the building and the seaside proportionally.
                            When I was looking at this image, I missed the time that I 
                            spent with my friends in high school. 
                            Therefore, I chose to record them by putting them 
                            in this web project.

                        Urvi sent me her image for this assignment.
                        The image shows her outfit when she was 
                        living in freshman dorm room. I like this image because 
                        it also reminds me my daily life when I was in freshman. 
                        I think everyone in college had their own important memories
                        when they were in freshman year. Therefore,
                        when I was looking at this image, I am interested about how
                        Urvi is going to deliver her freshman year experience to viewers.
                        When I was in freshman year, I was also very excited in my college life.
                        This image is very personal and simple. 
                        This two traits could brought out interesting
                        design and storylines. Urvi said that she recorded
                        her everyday outfit when she was in freshman year and 
                        this is reason why she chose this image. 
                        From this design objective, the image could lead out her personal life, 
                        letting viewer to know more about her. 
                        While I was looking at this image, it raised my curiosity
                        about her everyday outfits. At the same time, this could be
                        a meaningful event to display her college life to other students. 
                        I am really excited about her final result of this project.

                        <p>
                            The article gives me concepts about how to illustrate 
                            my story by using images. I agree with a lot the 
                            points inside but I also hold opinions about 
                            some of the aspects talked in this article. 
                            I do think practicing regularly would help with 
                            telling stories by images. While I was hanging out
                            with my friends, I always randomly took pictures
                            to record what was happening. On Monday after class, 
                            when I was going through pictures I took, 
                            I really enjoy the memories brought up by these pictures. 
                            Also, I could feel that these images could inspires 
                            viewer to communicate with each other about the contents. 
                            The part 8 of this article, it mentions about the 
                            photographer could use photographs to inspires audiences
                             sharing their points. I think this is one of the most 
                             important part of pictures—recording what is happening 
                             and bringing up different views. 
                        </p>
                    

                    
                    <p>
                    While I was reading the article, the image about 
                    asking open-ended questions attracted me a lot. 
                    I noticed one thing that I want to reflect when 
                    I was taking pictures—show respects to the people who 
                    present themselves in the picture and show respect 
                    to the content. When I was watching documentaries or 
                    pictures that describing developing countries on social media, 
                    I realized that a lot of photographers are placing themselves
                    in a higher position compared to the people in the photos. 
                    Talking about open-ended questions, the photo itself
                     shouldn't led an aspect to viewers. I hope when I was 
                     taking photos, I could deliver the pictures to 
                     audience without add my views in the picture.

                                Overuse of Overlay: This article gives me a better understanding with user interface. 
                                Actually, it reminds me the UIUX class I took last year. 
                                I totally agree with the article’s view about the causing of misused overlay. 
                                While I was taking my UIUX class last year, I checked a lot of websites
                                in order to learn about how to display my page properly. 
                                During that time, I was focusing adding overlays on my
                                design draft. However, I realized the complex overlay sometime 
                                cause confusion to users.
    
                            </p>
                        
    
                        
                        <p>
                   
                        When I was turning my design draft toward code, 
                        the logic of using overlay becomes blurry. They visually
                        looks good to the page on different sections. 
                        However, when I was testing out my website, I realized that I don’t 
                        need this much decoration as a user. Comparing to decorations, 
                        I would prefer its functionality. This makes me realized that logical
                        steps are super significant in website design. 
                        Especially, designers need to test out their process by considering 
                        themselves as users. This memory could get its answer from this article. 
                        Keep reflecting and updating our works are definitely important.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>
                        After reading Best practices for form design, 
                        I learned the importance of creating 
                        a connection between the users and the product. 
                        For example, the website needs to 
                        attract users through using psychological skills, 
                        such as letting them feel safe when they need to 
                        provide some private information and making users 
                        spend less time during the input process. 
                        I can relate with these suggestions. 
                        While purchasing stuff online, I will feel impatient
                        if the website asks me to register an account 
                        before checking out. During the creation of an account, 
                        I will reconsider whether I need to buy the stuff or not. 
                        Sometimes, I would end up realizing that the 
                        items in my cart are not necessary 
                        and won’t purchase them. If the website doesn't 
                        have the account creation process during the check out step, 
                        I will buy the items without consideration. 
                    </p>
                    

                    
                    <p>
                        As a designer, combining this story and the 
                        articles’ ideas makes me realize that the psychological 
                        path of users can not be ignored. Other than this experience, 
                        the article’s point about protecting users’ privacy brought
                        out another memory from my previous internship experience. 
                        At that time, I was working in a Robotic company which 
                        sells floor washing robots. The marketing team hoped to 
                        get some feedbacks from their users. However, less than 10% of 
                        the users were willing to let the company researchers 
                        visit their home. Also, the address they put did not 
                        include their door number, listing only the office 
                        location of their community. This situation changed when the 
                        website showed that users could get free gift if they provide 
                        their accurate addresses—including their door number. 
                        This story reflected the idea of making users feel safe about providing their 
                        information in the article. Therefore, after reading the article, 
                        the psychological skills it provided gave me a strong impression.
