                        After reading Best practices for form design, 
                        I learned the importance of creating 
                        a connection between the users and the product. 
                        For example, the website needs to 
                        attract users through using psychological skills, 
                        such as letting them feel safe when they need to 
                        provide some private information and making users 
                        spend less time during the input process. 
                        I can relate with these suggestions. 
                        While purchasing stuff online, I will feel impatient
                        if the website asks me to register an account 
                        before checking out. During the creation of an account, 
                        I will reconsider whether I need to buy the stuff or not. 
                        Sometimes, I would end up realizing that the 
                        items in my cart are not necessary 
                        and won’t purchase them. If the website doesn't 
                        have the account creation process during the check out step, 
                        I will buy the items without consideration. 
                    </p>
                    

                    
                    <p>
                        As a designer, combining this story and the 
                        articles’ ideas makes me realize that the psychological 
                        path of users can not be ignored. Other than this experience, 
                        the article’s point about protecting users’ privacy brought
                        out another memory from my previous internship experience. 
                        At that time, I was working in a Robotic company which 
                        sells floor washing robots. The marketing team hoped to 
                        get some feedbacks from their users. However, less than 10% of 
                        the users were willing to let the company researchers 
                        visit their home. Also, the address they put did not 
                        include their door number, listing only the office 
                        location of their community. This situation changed when the 
                        website showed that users could get free gift if they provide 
                        their accurate addresses—including their door number. 
                        This story reflected the idea of making users feel safe about providing their 
                        information in the article. Therefore, after reading the article, 
                        the psychological skills it provided gave me a strong impression.
