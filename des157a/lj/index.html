                        <p>
                        After reading Best practices for form design, 
                        I learned the importance of creating 
                        a connection between the users and the product. 
                        For example, the website needs to 
                        attract users through using psychological skills, 
                        such as letting them feel safe when they need to 
                        provide some private information and making users 
                        spend less time during the input process. 
                        I can relate with these suggestions. 
                        While purchasing stuff online, I will feel impatient
                        if the website asks me to register an account 
                        before checking out. During the creation of an account, 
                        I will reconsider whether I need to buy the stuff or not. 
                        Sometimes, I would end up realizing that the 
                        items in my cart are not necessary 
                        and won’t purchase them. If the website doesn't 
                        have the account creation process during the check out step, 
                        I will buy the items without consideration. 
                    </p>
                    

                    
                    <p>
                        As a designer, combining this story and the 
                        articles’ ideas makes me realize that the psychological 
                        path of users can not be ignored. Other than this experience, 
                        the article’s point about protecting users’ privacy brought
                        out another memory from my previous internship experience. 
                        At that time, I was working in a Robotic company which 
                        sells floor washing robots. The marketing team hoped to 
                        get some feedbacks from their users. However, less than 10% of 
                        the users were willing to let the company researchers 
                        visit their home. Also, the address they put did not 
                        include their door number, listing only the office 
                        location of their community. This situation changed when the 
                        website showed that users could get free gift if they provide 
                        their accurate addresses—including their door number. 
                        This story reflected the idea of making users feel safe about providing their 
                        information in the article. Therefore, after reading the article, 
                        the psychological skills it provided gave me a strong impression.

                    <p>
                        EXAMPLE:
                        <a href="https://www.therealreal.com">The Real Real shopping website
                        </a>
                        <p>This requires users to create an account before shopping, stopping my roommate to register an account. </p>
                    </p>
            
                </div>

                </article>
                
                <article class="article-card">
                    <figure class="article-image">
                        <img src="./num1.png" alt=bird>
                    </figure>                    
                    
    
                    <div class="article—content">
                        <h1 class="card-category">Journal Two</h1>
                        <h2 class="Date">Oct/27th</h1>
    
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>
                                The article gives me concepts about how to illustrate 
                                my story by using images. I agree with a lot the 
                                points inside but I also hold opinions about 
                                some of the aspects talked in this article. 
                                I do think practicing regularly would help with 
                                telling stories by images. While I was hanging out
                                with my friends, I always randomly took pictures
                                to record what was happening. On Monday after class, 
                                when I was going through pictures I took, 
                                I really enjoy the memories brought up by these pictures. 
                                Also, I could feel that these images could inspires 
                                viewer to communicate with each other about the contents. 
                                The part 8 of this article, it mentions about the 
                                photographer could use photographs to inspires audiences
                                 sharing their points. I think this is one of the most 
                                 important part of pictures—recording what is happening 
                                 and bringing up different views. 
                            </p>
                        
    
                        
                        <p>
                        While I was reading the article, the image about 
                        asking open-ended questions attracted me a lot. 
                        I noticed one thing that I want to reflect when 
                        I was taking pictures—show respects to the people who 
                        present themselves in the picture and show respect 
                        to the content. When I was watching documentaries or 
                        pictures that describing developing countries on social media, 
                        I realized that a lot of photographers are placing themselves
                        in a higher position compared to the people in the photos. 
                        Talking about open-ended questions, the photo itself
                         shouldn't led an aspect to viewers. I hope when I was 
                         taking photos, I could deliver the pictures to 
                         audience without add my views in the picture.

                            EXAMPLE:
                            <a href=https://bstd.ru/en/cherkasov>brand studio
                            </a>
                            <p>I admire this website because it described every person in this website 
                                with respects and using a joyful way to present their personalities. </p>
                        </p>
